## Introduction
This project was created during an [IoT challenge](https://www.hackfest.tn/iot-challenge/) ([backup description in case the first link is unavailable](https://web.archive.org/web/20201004004507/https://www.hackfest.tn/iot-challenge/)) ran in the [Hackfest](https://www.hackfest.tn/) event.

## Description
This project includes a study and a PoC regarding the possibility of the data exfiltration using the light. The study was performed using:

- A smart plug that have already a lamp configurable with multiple color setting.
- An [emitter](https://github.com/mohamedaymenkarmous/LightExfiltration/tree/main/Emitter) that is supposed to exfiltrate the data using the smart plug's lamp.
- A [receiver](https://github.com/mohamedaymenkarmous/LightExfiltration/tree/main/Receiver) that is supposed to use what the smart plug's lamp have shown to extract the exfiltrated data.
